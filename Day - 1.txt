1. How Java is different from other programming languages?

The main difference between Java and any other programming language is the unique method by which Java code is executed. Unlike compiled languages such as C++, Java is compiled into bytecode which can run on any device with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

2. Explain about public static void main(String[] args) ?

public static void main(String[] args) in Java — the entry point of any standalone Java application.

public:

Meaning: Access modifier — makes the method accessible from anywhere.
Why needed: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) must be able to call this method from outside your class, so it must be public.

static:

Meaning: Belongs to the class, not an object.
Why needed: JVM calls main() without creating an object of the class.
If it were not static, JVM would need to instantiate the class first.

void:

Meaning: The method does not return any value.
Why needed: JVM does not expect any return value from main() — it just executes the code inside.

main:

Meaning: The name of the method that JVM looks for as the starting point.
Why needed: This is the predefined method name recognized by JVM to start program execution.

String[] args

Meaning: An array of String objects that stores command-line arguments.
Why needed: Allows passing data to the program when it starts.

3. Write a sample program to print following:


    * * *
  * * * * *

public class StarPattern {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // First line: 3 stars
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            System.out.print("* ");
        }
        System.out.println(); // Move to next line

        // Second line: 5 stars
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.print("* ");
        }
        System.out.println(); // End output with a newline
    }
}
