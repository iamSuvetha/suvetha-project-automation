1. Explain about class and objects

Class
=====

- A class is like a blueprint or template.
- It defines what data (variables) and actions (methods) an object will have.

Example: A Car class might have data like color and speed, and actions like drive() or brake().



class Car {
 
   String color;   // data
    int speed;

   public void drive() {  

        System.out.println("Car is driving at " + speed + " km/h");

    }
}


Object
======

- An object is a real thing created from a class.
- Each object has its own values for the class’s variables.
- You can create many objects from one class, each with different data.

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Car car1 = new Car();   // object 1

        car1.color = "Red";
        car1.speed = 120;

        Car car2 = new Car();   // object 2
        car2.color = "Blue";
        car2.speed = 100;

        car1.drive();  // Car is driving at 120 km/h
        car2.drive();  // Car is driving at 100 km/h
    }
}



2. Create a program as  follows:

      Parent Class: Person who can walk,run,sit and has attributes height,weight
      Child Class: Student who has own method study and also can inherit the methods and properties from Person
     Print the results


// Parent Class
class Person {
    int height;
    int weight;

    // Constructor
    Person(int h, int w) {
        height = h;
        weight = w;
    }

    // Methods
    void walk() {

        System.out.println("Person is walking");
    }

    void run() {

        System.out.println("Person is running");
    }

    void sit() {
        System.out.println("Person is sitting");
    }

    void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("Height: " + height + " cm, Weight: " + weight + " kg");
    }
}

// Child Class
class Student extends Person {
    String name;

    // Constructor
    Student(String n, int h, int w) {
        super(h, w);  // call parent constructor
        name = n;
    }

    // Own method
    void study() {
        System.out.println(name + " is studying");
    }
}

// Main Class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create Student object
        Student s1 = new Student("Suvetha", 165, 55);

        // Access inherited methods
        s1.showDetails();
        s1.walk();
        s1.run();
        s1.sit();

        // Access child class method
        s1.study();
    }
}
